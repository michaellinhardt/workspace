# Request

In `./app.configs` is located my config for aerospace, jankyborder and sketchybar. Its already linked to my ~/ folder.

## Implement Settings

Go to this post `https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/discussions/47?sort=top#discussioncomment-4119308`

I want you to implement its exact config !

You start by split the implementation in task, create the tasks

Then you start to edit/install whatever needed to have the exact same setup.

All config file should remain in the 3 folder of app.configs, if you have to install something else, ensure its located in the appropriate folder and linked.
