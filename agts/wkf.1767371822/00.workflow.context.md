# Workflow Context

## Initial Request

User wants to run Claude Code within an Electron app on their computer with a specific Claude Code environment (MCP servers, agents, commands). They also use Claude Code personally and need both environments separated without conflicts.

## Goal

- Electron app: dedicated Claude Code config (MCPs, agents, CLAUDE.md)
- Personal use: standard Claude Code config in `~/.claude`
- No interference between the two

## Acceptance Criteria

- Clear documentation explaining the problem and solution
- Implementation details for the selected approach
- File saved as `grimoire.claude.spawn.md`

## Tasks

- [x] Analyze request and identify solutions
- [x] Select optimal solution (HOME override)
- [x] Write grimoire documentation file

## Output

- `01.grimoire.claude.spawn.md` - Complete documentation

---

## Closure Report

### Tasks Completed

1. **Analyzed request** - Identified need for dual Claude Code environments
2. **Evaluated solutions** - Compared 4 approaches (HOME override, project isolation, Docker, wrapper script)
3. **Selected optimal solution** - HOME environment override for complete isolation with native performance
4. **Wrote grimoire** - Full documentation with implementation details

### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `00.workflow.context.md` | Workflow tracking |
| `01.grimoire.claude.spawn.md` | Complete grimoire documentation |

### Grimoire Contents

- 4 solutions evaluated with trade-offs
- Selected solution rationale
- Full implementation:
  - Directory structure
  - Initial setup commands
  - Electron spawn code (3 variants)
  - Configuration file examples
  - Custom command example
  - Verification steps
  - Troubleshooting guide

**Status:** Complete
