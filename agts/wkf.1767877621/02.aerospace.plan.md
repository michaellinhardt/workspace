# Aerospace Implementation Plan

## Verified Issues

### Confirmed: Comment-Configuration Mismatch (Priority 1)

The comment on lines 63-64 is factually incorrect:

- **Comment states**: "Workspaces 1, 2, 3 -> Main monitor / Workspaces 4, 5 -> Secondary monitor"
- **Actual config**: Workspaces 1-4 on main, 5-6 on secondary

This is a documentation accuracy issue that should be fixed to prevent confusion.

### Acknowledged: Other Review Items (No Action Required)

1. **`on-mode-changed = []` (line 76)**: While technically a no-op, it serves as documentation with reference links. Removing would reduce discoverability of the feature. **No change recommended.**

2. **Workspaces 7-9 unassigned**: This is intentional design. These serve as "overflow" workspaces that follow default behavior (placed on current monitor). This is a common pattern in tiling WM configurations for temporary workspace needs. **No change recommended.**

3. **Border color override**: The inline `borders` command intentionally uses custom colors (orange/dark theme) rather than Tokyo Night from bordersrc. This is user preference. **No change recommended.**

## Changes Required

### Single Change: Update workspace-to-monitor comment

**Location**: `/Users/teazyou/workspace/app.configs/aerospace/aerospace.toml`, lines 63-64

**Current**:
```toml
# Assign workspaces to specific monitors
# Workspaces 1, 2, 3 -> Main monitor
# Workspaces 4, 5 -> Secondary monitor
```

**Updated**:
```toml
# Assign workspaces to specific monitors
# Workspaces 1, 2, 3, 4 -> Main monitor
# Workspaces 5, 6 -> Secondary monitor
```

## Files to Modify

- `/Users/teazyou/workspace/app.configs/aerospace/aerospace.toml`: Update comment on lines 63-64 to accurately reflect the actual workspace-to-monitor assignments

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: Minimal

- This is a comment-only change with no functional impact
- The configuration itself is correct; only the documentation is inaccurate
- No testing required beyond visual verification

**Recommendation**: Approve for immediate implementation.
