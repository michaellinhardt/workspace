# Request

## Tasks

I want you to modify the claude-code agent given in the resources by following the `Change to be done`.

Output the improved agent file entirely as an artefact.

ONLY MODIFY what is related to my request ! Do not modify what I did not request for !

## Resources

You will be provided this resources

- `@.claude/CLAUDE.md` the project workflow for agent to operate
- The current agent to improve

## Change to be done

### Agentic Workflow

Ensure that the agent file reflect that it will be used in an agentic workflow with no human to read it's output. It should provide the expected result / files / output without human-verbose-oriented output. Once it's task accomplished, another agent in the workflow will be running and proceed the next steps on it's own.

Ensure that the agent follow this principle by adding constraint or rule to respect this request.
