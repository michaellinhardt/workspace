3. Generate `aerospace.context.html` - a landing page to present the report in a readable format

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete research of AeroSpace features and capabilities
- [ ] Pricing clarified (free/paid)
- [ ] macOS installation steps documented
- [ ] HTML landing page created for easy reading

## Status
- Started: 2026-01-02
- Completed: 2026-01-02

## Workflow Extension: SketchyBar Configuration Migration

### Request
Move the Sketchybar configuration from `~/.config/sketchybar` to `/Users/teazyou/workspace/app.configs/sketchybar` and create a symlink for seamless integration.

### Tasks Accomplished

1. **Directory Verification** - Confirmed existence of `~/.config/sketchybar` with plugins directory and sketchybarrc configuration file
2. **Migration** - Successfully moved the entire sketchybar directory from `~/.config/sketchybar` to `/Users/teazyou/workspace/app.configs/sketchybar`
3. **Symlink Creation** - Created symbolic link from `~/.config/sketchybar` pointing to `/Users/teazyou/workspace/app.configs/sketchybar`
4. **Symlink Verification** - Confirmed symlink is valid and resolves correctly to the workspace location
5. **Service Restart** - Restarted sketchybar service via `brew services restart sketchybar`
6. **Service Status** - Verified sketchybar is running (started) after restart

### Files Moved

| Original Location | New Location |
|-------------------|--------------|
| `~/.config/sketchybar` | `/Users/teazyou/workspace/app.configs/sketchybar` |
| `~/.config/sketchybar/sketchybarrc` | `/Users/teazyou/workspace/app.configs/sketchybar/sketchybarrc` |
| `~/.config/sketchybar/plugins/` | `/Users/teazyou/workspace/app.configs/sketchybar/plugins/` |
