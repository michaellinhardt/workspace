# Workflow Context

## Initial Request
Sketchybar configuration enhancement workflow - extracting features from community dotfiles and implementing them.

## Purpose
Analyze GitHub dotfiles repositories for sketchybar configurations and implement specific features into the user's setup.

## Method
1. Parallel sub-agents analyze external dotfiles repositories
2. Each sub-agent produces a `[feature].dotfiles.md` documentation file
3. Implementation agents consume documentation and apply changes
4. Research agent investigates workspace app name display feature

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Font settings extracted from neutonfoo/dotfiles
- [x] Visibility and color settings extracted from CriticalElement/dotfiles
- [x] Research completed on workspace app name display
- [x] All features implemented in user's sketchybar config
- [x] Apple icon removed from sketchybar
