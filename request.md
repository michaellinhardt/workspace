# Request

I need you to modify the @claude-code/claude-agents/agt-code-plan-review agents.

Currently when it does its review, it generate a new plan with "_REVISED" before the extention name.

This is not the behavior I want ! This agent should edit the existing plan that is reviewing without generating any new file.

Make the necessary modification to ensure this behavior and do not modify anything else.
