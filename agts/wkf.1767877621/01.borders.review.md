# Borders Review

## Summary

The `bordersrc` file is a JankyBorders configuration script that applies window border styling on macOS. It uses Tokyo Night theme colors with rounded borders at 4px width. The configuration is minimal, well-documented, and follows bash best practices.

## Clean Code

**Strengths:**

- Clear header comments explaining the theme and available options
- Helpful inline documentation for color format (0xAARRGGBB)
- Style options are listed in the comment for reference
- Use of bash array for options is clean and maintainable
- Commented examples of additional options provide good discoverability
- Logical grouping: active settings followed by commented optional settings

**Minor Observations:**

- No issues identified. The file is appropriately concise for its purpose.

## Potential Errors

**No errors found.** All values appear valid:

- `style=round` - Valid option (round/square/uniform)
- `width=4.0` - Valid float value
- `hidpi=on` - Valid boolean-style option
- `active_color=0xffc0caf5` - Valid hex color (Tokyo Night foreground blue)
- `inactive_color=0xff414868` - Valid hex color (Tokyo Night comment gray)

**Note:** The shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) is present, which is correct since this script uses bash array syntax that is not POSIX-compatible.

## Performance Optimization

**No optimizations needed.** This is a one-time configuration script that:

- Defines a single array
- Makes one command call
- Has no loops, conditionals, or external process calls

The script is already as minimal as possible while remaining readable and maintainable.

## Recommendations

No changes recommended. The configuration is:

1. **Clean** - Well-structured with helpful comments
2. **Correct** - All values are valid for JankyBorders
3. **Efficient** - Minimal execution footprint
4. **Maintainable** - Easy to modify with documented alternatives

This is a well-crafted configuration file that follows best practices for shell-based config files.
