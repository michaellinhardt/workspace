# AeroSpace Workspace Setup Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the configuration changes needed to set up persistent workspaces with monitor assignments in AeroSpace tiling window manager.

## Requirements

1. **Persistent Workspaces**: Workspaces 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 should always be visible (even when empty)
2. **Monitor Assignment**:
   - Workspaces 1, 2, 3 assigned to MAIN display
   - Workspaces 4, 5 assigned to SECONDARY display

## Current Configuration Analysis

The current config has:
- `persistent-workspaces = ["1", "2", "3", "10", "11"]`
- Keybindings map `alt-4` to workspace `10` and `alt-5` to workspace `11`
- No `workspace-to-monitor-force-assignment` configuration

## Changes Needed

### 1. Update Persistent Workspaces

Change from:
```toml
persistent-workspaces = ["1", "2", "3", "10", "11"]
```

To:
```toml
persistent-workspaces = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]
```

This ensures workspaces 1-5 remain visible even when empty.

### 2. Add Workspace-to-Monitor Force Assignment

Add new section after `persistent-workspaces`:

```toml
# Assign workspaces to specific monitors
# Workspaces 1, 2, 3 -> Main monitor
# Workspaces 4, 5 -> Secondary monitor
[workspace-to-monitor-force-assignment]
    1 = 'main'
    2 = 'main'
    3 = 'main'
    4 = 'secondary'
    5 = 'secondary'
```

**Configuration Options Explained:**
- `main` - Refers to the primary/main display as designated by macOS
- `secondary` - Refers to non-main monitors in a two-monitor setup
- The assignment is "forced", meaning `move-workspace-to-monitor` commands will have no effect on these workspaces

### 3. Update Keybindings

Change the workspace switch keybindings from:
```toml
alt-4 = 'workspace 10'
alt-5 = 'workspace 11'
```

To:
```toml
alt-4 = 'workspace 4'
alt-5 = 'workspace 5'
```

This makes the keybindings consistent with the workspace numbering (alt-4 goes to workspace 4, alt-5 goes to workspace 5).

### 4. Update Move-Node-to-Workspace Keybindings

The existing config already has `alt-shift-4 = 'move-node-to-workspace 4'` and `alt-shift-5 = 'move-node-to-workspace 5'`, which are correct.

## Complete Configuration Snippet

Here is the complete set of changes to apply:

```toml
# Persistent workspaces (workspaces 1-5 always visible)
persistent-workspaces = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]

# Assign workspaces to specific monitors
# Workspaces 1, 2, 3 -> Main monitor
# Workspaces 4, 5 -> Secondary monitor
[workspace-to-monitor-force-assignment]
    1 = 'main'
    2 = 'main'
    3 = 'main'
    4 = 'secondary'
    5 = 'secondary'

# In [mode.main.binding] section:
alt-4 = 'workspace 4'
alt-5 = 'workspace 5'
```

## How to Apply

1. Edit `/Users/teazyou/workspace/app.configs/aerospace/aerospace.toml`
2. Update the `persistent-workspaces` line
3. Add the `[workspace-to-monitor-force-assignment]` section after line 48 (after persistent-workspaces)
4. Update the keybindings for alt-4 and alt-5
5. Reload AeroSpace config (usually via service mode: alt-shift-; then esc)

## Notes

- The `workspace-to-monitor-force-assignment` feature requires `config-version = 2` (already set in current config)
- Monitor pattern `secondary` works specifically in two-monitor setups
- If you have more monitors, you can use regex patterns like `'dell.*'` or numeric indices like `1`, `2`, `3`
