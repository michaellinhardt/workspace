# Workflow Context

## Initial Request
Multi-phase code review and improvement workflow for 3 UI configuration folders.

## Purpose
Review, plan, and implement improvements for aerospace, borders, and sketchybar configurations.

## Method
1. **Review**: 3 parallel tech lead agents review each folder
2. **Make Plan**: As reviews complete, new agents verify and create plans
3. **Review Plans**: Single agent creates master.plan.md
4. **Implement**: Single agent executes master plan

## Folders
- `./app.configs/aerospace`
- `./app.configs/borders`
- `./app.configs/sketchybar`

## File Guide Location
`./app.configs/guide.files.md`

## Acceptance Criteria
- All folders reviewed for clean code, errors, performance
- Individual plans created where needed
- Master plan consolidates all changes
- Changes implemented without breaking integration

## Status
- [x] Phase 1: Review (3 agents)
- [x] Phase 2: Make Plan (per review)
- [x] Phase 3: Review Plans (1 agent)
- [x] Phase 4: Implement (1 agent)
