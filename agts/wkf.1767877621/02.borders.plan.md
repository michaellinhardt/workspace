## Verified Issues

No issues identified. The review was verified against the actual configuration file and all assessments are accurate.

**Verification Results:**

| Review Claim | Verification Status |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Tokyo Night theme colors | Confirmed - `0xffc0caf5` (active) and `0xff414868` (inactive) match Tokyo Night palette |
| Valid style option | Confirmed - `style=round` is a valid JankyBorders option |
| Valid width value | Confirmed - `width=4.0` is a valid float |
| Valid hidpi setting | Confirmed - `hidpi=on` is correct syntax |
| Bash array syntax requires bash shebang | Confirmed - shebang is present and correct |
| File matches guide.files.md description | Confirmed - guide accurately describes the config |

## Changes Required

No changes required.

## Justification

1. **Configuration Correctness** - All JankyBorders options use valid syntax and values
2. **Theme Consistency** - Colors align with Tokyo Night theme as documented
3. **Code Quality** - Clean structure with helpful comments for maintainability
4. **Documentation Alignment** - The `guide.files.md` accurately reflects the current config state
5. **Performance** - Single command execution with no optimization opportunities

## Files to Modify

None.

## Risk Assessment

**Current State Risk: Low**

The configuration is stable, well-documented, and follows best practices. No modifications are needed at this time.

**Note:** If future changes are desired (e.g., theme updates, adding blacklist/whitelist), the commented options in the config provide clear guidance for implementation.
