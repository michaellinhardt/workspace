# Request

Go into the folder `~/secondbrain/restorant/rotations` which is my restaurant 2-weeks rotation of dish.

I want you to read the last 5 rotations file and then generate the next one with only new dish which are not in the past 5 rotation.

Dish have to be from one of those countries:

- Korean
- Japanese
- French
- American

This is for my restaurant menu and I'd like dish which are

1) cultural
2) easy to cook
3) good margin
4) fast to cook
5) Can I froze it
6) I can prepare a bit in advance or batch

When you create a rotation for next cycle, you have to follow the exact same structure and informations from the other files.
