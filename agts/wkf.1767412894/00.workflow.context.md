# Workflow Context

## Initial Request
Fix sketchybar configuration issues:
1. Increase bar border by 1px
2. Fix settings icon alignment (300px gap from right edge)
3. Remove "+" icon from workspace list

## Workflow Purpose
Apply visual and layout fixes to the user's sketchybar configuration.

## Method
1. Read relevant config files (sketchybarrc, settings.sh, spaces.sh)
2. Identify the specific settings causing each issue
3. Apply targeted edits to fix each problem

## Acceptance Criteria
- Border width increased from 1px to 2px
- Settings icon positioned closer to right edge
- "+" button removed from workspace section

---

## Execution Report

### Tasks Accomplished
1. **Border Width Increase**: Changed `background.border_width` from `1` to `2` in `/Users/teazyou/workspace/app.configs/sketchybar/sketchybarrc` (line 44)

2. **Settings Icon Alignment Fix**: Modified `/Users/teazyou/workspace/app.configs/sketchybar/items/settings.sh`:
   - Reduced `background.padding_left` from `18` to `6`
   - Added `background.padding_right=0` to minimize right-edge gap

3. **Removed "+" Icon**: Modified `/Users/teazyou/workspace/app.configs/sketchybar/items/spaces.sh`:
   - Commented out the `new_space` item creation (lines 47-57)
   - Removed `new_space` from the bracket definition (line 70)

### Project Files Edited
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `app.configs/sketchybar/sketchybarrc` | `background.border_width` 1 -> 2 |
| `app.configs/sketchybar/items/settings.sh` | Reduced padding for better right alignment |
| `app.configs/sketchybar/items/spaces.sh` | Commented out "+" button, removed from bracket |

### Notes
- To apply changes, restart sketchybar: `sketchybar --reload`
- The 300px gap may have been caused by cumulative `background.padding_left=18` on all right-side items; if the gap persists, consider reducing padding on other right-side items as well
