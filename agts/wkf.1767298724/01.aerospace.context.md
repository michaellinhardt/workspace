# AeroSpace Tiling Window Manager - Research Context

## Overview

AeroSpace is an i3-like tiling window manager for macOS that brings Linux-style window management to Apple's operating system. Currently in public beta, it is designed for advanced users and developers who prefer keyboard-centric workflows.

**Repository:** https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace
**Documentation:** https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide
**License:** MIT (Open Source, Free)

## Pricing

**Free and Open Source** - AeroSpace is released under the MIT license, allowing broad usage rights with no cost.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Core Features

- **Tree-based window paradigm** - Inspired by i3, windows are organized in a hierarchical tree structure where containers have layout and orientation properties
- **Fast workspace switching** - No animations, instant switching without requiring SIP (System Integrity Protection) to be disabled
- **Custom workspace emulation** - Reimplements macOS Spaces as "workspaces" to overcome native Spaces limitations
- **Plain text configuration** - TOML-based config files compatible with dotfiles management
- **CLI-first design** - Includes manpages and shell completion support
- **Multi-monitor support** - Follows i3's paradigm for proper display handling with shared workspaces across monitors

### Layout Options

1. **h_tiles** - Horizontal side-by-side arrangement
2. **v_tiles** - Vertical side-by-side arrangement
3. **h_accordion** - Horizontal stacked windows with padding indicators
4. **v_accordion** - Vertical stacked windows with padding indicators

### Advanced Capabilities

- **Binding modes** - Create multiple sets of keyboard bindings for context-specific commands
- **On-window-detected callbacks** - Automatically manage new windows based on app ID, window title, or workspace
- **Floating window support** - Toggle windows between tiled and floating state
- **Fullscreen modes** - Both AeroSpace fullscreen and native macOS fullscreen
- **Balance sizes** - Equalize window dimensions across workspace

### Integration Ecosystem

- Raycast extension for command discovery
- Sketchybar and simple-bar compatibility for workspace visualization
- JankyBorders support for visual window focus indicators
- Trackpad gesture integration for workspace switching

    alt-shift-2 = 'move-node-to-workspace 2'
    # ... and so on

[mode.main.binding]
    alt-r = 'mode resize'

[mode.resize.binding]
    minus = 'resize smart -50'
    equal = 'resize smart +50'
    esc = 'mode main'
```

### Window Detection Callbacks

```toml
[[on-window-detected]]
if.app-id = 'com.apple.finder'
run = 'layout floating'

[[on-window-detected]]
if.app-id = 'com.spotify.client'
run = 'move-node-to-workspace music'
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts (Default)

| `alt-1` to `alt-9` | Switch to workspace 1-9 |
| `alt-a` to `alt-z` | Switch to workspace A-Z |
| `alt-shift-1` to `alt-shift-9` | Move window to workspace 1-9 |

### Layout Control

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `alt-/` (slash) | Switch to tiles layout |
| `alt-,` (comma) | Switch to accordion layout |
| `alt-minus` | Resize smaller |

## Comparison with Similar Tools

### AeroSpace vs Yabai vs Amethyst

| Feature | AeroSpace | Yabai | Amethyst |
|---------|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Ease of setup** | Medium | Complex | Easy |
| **Requires SIP disabled** | No | Yes (for full features) | No |
| **Configuration** | TOML file | Shell scripts | GUI + config |
| **Extensibility** | Good | Excellent | Limited |
| **Stability** | Excellent | May lose window tracking | Good |
| **Animation-free switching** | Yes | Some animations remain | Some animations |
| **Built-in hotkey manager** | Yes | No (needs skhd) | Yes |
| **Window shadows control** | No | Yes | No |
| **Monitor plug/unplug handling** | Reliable | Can be problematic | Good |

### Detailed Comparison

#### Amethyst
- **Pros:** Easiest to get started, sensible defaults, native macOS app
- **Cons:** Limited extensibility, issues with cross-screen window management, no mouse-follows-focus

#### Yabai
- **Pros:** Most popular, most feature-complete, strong community, works with Sketchybar
- **Cons:** Requires SIP disabled for full features, needs external hotkey manager (skhd), can lose track of windows after monitor changes, needs multiple scripts for essential features

#### AeroSpace
- **Pros:** No SIP required, works reliably with monitor changes, built-in hotkey modes with indicators, minimal configuration needed, animation-free workspace switching
- **Cons:** Uses virtual spaces (windows positioned just out of view), fewer advanced customization options than Yabai

### User Verdict

Many users who have tried Rectangle, Amethyst, and Yabai report settling on AeroSpace because it is "nice and stable and gets the job done" without the complexity of Yabai or the limitations of Amethyst.

## macOS Settings Recommendations

For optimal AeroSpace performance:

1. **Disable "Displays have separate Spaces":**
   ```bash
   defaults write com.apple.spaces spans-displays -bool true
   ```
   Then log out and log back in.

2. **Enable "Group windows by application"** in Mission Control settings for better compatibility

3. **Arrange monitors** to ensure free corner space for hiding inactive workspace windows

4. **Disable Dock auto-hide delay** (optional):
   ```bash
   defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0
   defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0
   killall Dock
   ```

## Core Design Principles

1. **Keyboard-centric interaction** - Designed for users who prefer keyboard over mouse
2. **Practical features over cosmetics** - Focuses on functionality rather than visual enhancements
3. **Minimal private API usage** - Only uses `_AXUIElementGetWindow` for accessibility
4. **Plain text configuration** - No GUI configuration, text-based only
5. **CLI-first approach** - All features accessible via command line
